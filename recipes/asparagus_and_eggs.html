<h2>How to Make Asparagus and Eggs</h2>
<p>Asparagus and eggs make the best spring breakfast or a beautiful light lunch. Asparagus is cooked in a pan with a <br>b>little oil, and topped with two eggs.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<p><ul>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
<li>8 thin-stemmed asparagus stalks, trimmed</li>
<li>2 large eggs</li>
<li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
<li>1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
</ul>
<H2>Directions</H2>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong><br>Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and garlic; <br>cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong><br>Add asparagus and cook until fork-tender, turning asparagus often to <br>ensure even cooking, about 4 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong><br>Spread asparagus out and crack 2 eggs over the asparagus. Cover with <br>lid and cook until egg whites are firm and yolk is done to desired <br>consistency, about 4 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong><br>Season with salt and pepper; sprinkle with red pepper flakes and serve <br>immediately.</p>
