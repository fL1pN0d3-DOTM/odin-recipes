        <h2>How to Make Broccoli Alfredo Pasta</h2>
        <p>This broccoli Alfredo pasta is so pretty made with farfalle, also called bow-tie pasta. Of course, you may use <br>fettuccine if you prefer. As a main dish, this serves 2; as a side, it serves 4. Add a salad, if you wish, and some bread. We love it as a side with grilled chicken or shrimp.</p>
        <p><strong>Broccoli Alfredo Pasta Ingredients</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ounces farfalle pasta</li>
            <li>2 cups fresh broccoli florets</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter </li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (see Note)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg, or to taste</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>fresh parsley sprigs for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p><strong>Step 1</strong><br>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook farfalle pasta at a <br>boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 <br>minutes. Remove to a colander; reserve the pasta water for later use.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2</strong><br>Add broccoli to a microwave-safe container along with 1/4 cup water. <br>Cover and cook on High until bright green and tender with a bite, about <br>4 minutes. Drain; season with salt. Keep warm.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3</strong><br>Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet or saucepan over low heat. Stir in <br>cream and allow to simmer, stirring often, 3 to 4 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4</strong><br>Add cheese and garlic, stirring continuously, until cheese is melted. Stir <br> in nutmeg and remove from heat. sauce is too thick, stir in a bit of <br>reserved pasta water. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5</strong><br>To serve, combine cooked pasta, cooked broccoli, and sauce. Garnish <br>with fresh parsley sprigs, if desired.</p>
